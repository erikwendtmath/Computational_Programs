mdCopyEdit# Compuational Programs
## Description
This project contains many of the computational files I have used in my teaching. Teaching mathematics is difficult, but these programs can illustrate mathematics concepts in a way that working on a blackboard cannot. By implementing simple, generalizble programs which are able to simulate many examples, I hope to shine a light on the potential (and limitations) of computational mathematics.

For accessibility, all of the programs in this repository are written in python.
