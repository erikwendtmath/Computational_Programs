## Description
This project contains many of the computational files I have used in my teaching. Teaching mathematics is difficult, but these programs can illustrate mathematics concepts in a way that working on a blackboard cannot. By implementing simple, generalizble programs which are able to simulate many examples, I hope to shine a light on the potential (and limitations) of computational mathematics.

For accessibility, all of the programs in this repository are written in python. In the future, I plan on writing some of the code in C++ to exhibit differences in efficiency between both languages.

Euler's Method Programs:
-----------------------
eulers.py - main implmentation of Euler's method
eulerTest.py - test file
eulers_vfield.py - plot a parameterized vector field with a changing Euler's method solution. Main function described in the blog post.
vfield_ang_comp.py - compare the angle change between two vector fields.
vfield_mag_comp.py - compare the change in magnitude between two vector fields.

Eigenvalue Visualization Programs:
-------------------------
eigenAnimation.py - creates the eigenvalue visualizer.
eigenTest.py - tests the visualizer's settings. As of now, everything works as intended.
